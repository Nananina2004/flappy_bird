# Flappy Bird

This is a simple implementation of the popular game Flappy Bird using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows players to control a bird and navigate through gaps between columns to earn points. The game features a tap-to-play mechanic, score tracking, and a game over screen.

## Demo

You can play the game by opening the `bird.html` file in your web browser.

## Gameplay

- Tap the spacebar to make the bird flap and navigate through the columns.
- Earn points by successfully passing through the gaps between the columns.
- If the bird hits the ground or collides with a column, the game ends.
- The highest score achieved during the session is recorded as the max score.

## Project Structure
